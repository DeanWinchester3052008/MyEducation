                Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently
                takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place
                in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may
                be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.education in zambia</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag textSmall">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
                society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge
                ,
                values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills th
                at could
                be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the M
